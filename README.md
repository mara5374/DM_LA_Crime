Using the City of Los Angeles’ “Crime Data from 2010 to the Present”, this project sought 
to find interesting patterns in the victimhood of violent and property crimes. 
The Los Angeles Times, which maps crime rates in Los Angeles County, defines violent crime 
as homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery. 
Property crimes include burglary, theft, grand theft auto, and theft from vehicle. 
Specifically, we applied association rule mining and random forest classification 
to find the relationships between the type of crime committed and victim characteristics such as age range, sex, race, and location.
We found that sex and race play a large role in predicting whether or not a crime was violent, with Black and Latina women being especially at risk for violent offenses. These findings can be used for work in the areas of victim advocacy, crime matching, and law enforcement.
