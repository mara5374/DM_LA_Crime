Using the City of Los Angeles’ “Crime Data from 2010 to the Present”, this project sought 
to find interesting patterns in the victimhood of violent and property crimes. 
The Los Angeles Times, which maps crime rates in Los Angeles County, defines violent crime 
as homicide, rape, aggravated assault, and robbery. 
Property crimes include burglary, theft, grand theft auto, and theft from vehicle. 
Specifically, we applied association rule mining and random tree classification 
to predict the type of crime committed based on victim characteristics such as age range, sex, race, and location.
